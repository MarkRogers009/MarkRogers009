## Mark Rogers
- My intended major is computer engineering.
- Over the course of this semester, I am going to be working on two projects:

  - The first project is for my D&D campaign. I want to try and make a random encounter generator that will be able to generate an amount of monsters for a random encounter.
  - The second project that I am working on is also for my D&D campaign. I want to try and make a program that stores the descriptions of places and events that exist in the campaign, so I can easily get the right description without going through my notes.
